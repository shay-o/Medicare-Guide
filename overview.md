## Zen 
This is a project to help me learn about AI while simultaneously learning more about how software, AI and otherwise, can be used to help people access government services

## Goals
Learn about AI so that I can apply it in job hunting and job execution
- Standard Dev Tools with AI: Git Hub, VS Code, Python
- AI tools: Claude Code, CoPilot, LLM Apps (ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexitty)
- Common AI architectures and techniques like MCP, agents and evals
Gain domain knowledge about civic tech problem
Learn about Civic Tech and how/if AI can be applied to it
Help my own personal understanding of AI

## Outcomes
Follow a structured schedule/curriculum
Document my process and findings. 
Publish the code and learnings on GitHub
Code and findings I can share with potential employers
Functioning prototype that can be used by anyone to get support in using government services. This will be proof-of-concept. Ideally it can be used for real problems but this is not necessary.
