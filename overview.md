- Week 3 – Build simple retrieval script and 50-item evaluation set
- Week 4 – Run evaluations, fix failure modes, publish write-up and demo

## Outcomes
- A public repo with:
  - Working prototype site
  - Clear documentation of approach and tradeoffs
  - Example data and evaluators
- A concise write-up suitable for portfolios and applications.
