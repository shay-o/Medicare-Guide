# Medicare Guide Prototype

This is a static single-page app helping Medicare beneficiaries understand benefits through guided tasks and educational content.

## Stack
- Vanilla JavaScript (assets/app.js) - All application logic
- Tailwind CSS via CDN
- JSON content database (assets/seed.json) - Content and routing

## Key Concepts
- **Free text + topic buttons**: Users can type keywords or click topic buttons (either/or interface with "OR" separator)
- **Keyword routing**: Simple substring matching via routing_table in seed.json, with fallback to topic label search
- **Dual card types**: Different renderers for "Do" cards (steps, costs, warnings) and "Learn" cards (definitions, examples, key terms)
- **Q&A system**: Suggested questions, free-text input, micro-explanations ("Explain this step")
- **Centralized state**: Simple state object drives all rendering
- **No intent selection**: Removed "What would you like to do?" section - all topics shown together

## Main Files
- `index.html` - UI with Context (optional), topic selection, and Go button
- `assets/app.js` - All application logic: routing, rendering, Q&A heuristics, event handlers
- `assets/seed.json` - Content database with topics array and routing_table for keyword matching

## Current Topics
1. do_shingles_vaccine - Get the shingles vaccine (task)
2. do_get_mri - Get an MRI (task)
3. learn_deductible_vs_coinsurance - Educational content
4. learn_part_b_overview - What Part B covers (educational)
5. learn_medicare_parts - Understanding Medicare Parts A, B, C, D (educational) **[RECENTLY ADDED]**

## Planned Educational Topics (based on CMS/Medicare.gov research)
Content strategy: Building educational topics to help users understand coverage
- [x] Understanding Medicare Parts (A, B, C, D) - ADDED
- [ ] Out-of-Pocket Maximum (MOOP) - explains limits for MA ($9,350), Part D ($2,000), none for Original Medicare
- [ ] Preventive Services Covered at No Cost - which services are free, requirements
- [ ] Original Medicare vs Medicare Advantage - key differences in coverage, costs, networks
- [ ] Copay vs Coinsurance vs Deductible - expand existing topic with 2025 numbers

## User Flow
1. (Optional) Enter ZIP and plan type in Context section
2. Type a keyword/question OR click a topic button
3. Click "Go" button
4. App routes to matching topic (shows "No match found" error if no match)
5. Card renders with relevant content
6. User can ask follow-up questions or get step-by-step explanations

## Design Principles
- Guidance only, not benefits determination
- Lightweight and dependency-free
- Content-as-configuration (editable JSON)
- Simple heuristic Q&A (can be enhanced with backend/LLM)
- Content based on publicly available CMS/Medicare.gov documentation
